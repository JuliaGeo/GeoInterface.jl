module GeoInterfaceRecipes

# This package is deprecated. Plotting recipes are now built into GeoInterface.jl
# as package extensions. See:
# - GeoInterfaceRecipesBaseExt for Plots.jl support
# - GeoInterfaceMakieExt for Makie.jl support
#
# This empty package exists only to allow smooth upgrades for users who had
# GeoInterfaceRecipes.jl installed. No action is needed - simply load
# GeoInterface with Plots or Makie and the recipes will work automatically.
